      Student: Hi, I need help enrolling in a course that requires a prerequisite. I'm in my 3rd year in the Computer Science program and the class code is CS401. The prereq is CS301 which I haven't completed.
      Advisor: Hello — no problem. You must take CS301 first. Contact the department.
      Student: The department says CS301 was full last semester and I'm on a scholarship deadline. Is there any way to enroll?
      Advisor: If it's full, try the waitlist. If waitlist fails, petition for a prerequisite waiver with the chair.
    expected: "Should provide detailed scoring and constructive feedback including alternative academic solutions, resource referral and a more proactive tone."
