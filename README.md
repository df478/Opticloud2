## 📌 Multi-Agent Automated Service Desk for Education

# 🎓 Multi-Agent Service Desk Automation

### Empowering universities with AI-driven support — fast, safe, and transparent

---

## 🚀 Overview

Large educational institutions struggle with repetitive service desk requests—password resets, course enrollment inquiries, transcript requests, and more. This leads to long wait times, frustrated students, and high operational costs.

Our solution introduces a **multi-agent automation platform** that intelligently resolves routine cases while escalating only the complex ones to human staff. It works across **web chat and voice**, ensuring accessibility for all users.

## 🤖 System Capabilities

✔ Multi-agent collaboration for accurate understanding and routing
✔ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (**RAG**) for trusted academic knowledge
✔ Automated execution through secure **Runbooks**
✔ Transparent decision-making and **graceful escalation** to humans
✔ Support for multiple service domains:

* **IT Support** (password resets, network issues, software access)
* **Student Services** (course planning, records, campus info)
* **Administrative Services** (special workflows, compliance)
